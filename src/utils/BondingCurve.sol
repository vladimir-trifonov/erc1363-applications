 *
 *     T(p) = cubeRoot((p / MULTIPLIER) * 3 + (s + 1) ^ 3) - s - 1
 *
 * where s is the current token supply, n is the number of tokens being purchased, p is the amount
 * of Ether being spent, and MULTIPLIER is 10^6. The bonding curve function is a cubic function.

     * mid of the search range and raises it to the n-th power. If mid^n is equal to x,
     * the function returns mid as the result. If mid^n is less than x, the search range is

     * the search range is reduced to a single integer value, which is then returned as the
     * largest integer y such that y^n <= x.

     * Note: The binary search algorithm implemented in the nthRoot function has a time complexity
     * of O(log x), which makes it more efficient than Newton's method for large values of x.

     * non-negative real number x, which is a limitation of the algorithm.
